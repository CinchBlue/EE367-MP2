So I made a small program called "size" in order to print out how many bytes are
in a text-based file. There's also an optional flag for argument 2 for outputing
the size of the file divided by 8, which is useful for the encoded files.

# The size for each file are the following (uncoded, encoded, encoded/uncoded%):

 - FrenchLanguage.html              (24713, 15733, 63.66%)
 - SomeSpanishStoryIDontKnow.html   (73201, 47867, 65.39%)
 - TheLottery.html                  (24887, 15214, 61.13%)
